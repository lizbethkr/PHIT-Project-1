# PHIT-Project 1
This project is for UCI's Public Health Informatics and Technology (PHIT) internship with [Wu Enviornmental Lab]([https://drwulab.net/]) at UCI.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand the importance of monitoring temperature trends and the impact of extreme heat events on public health and the enviornment. This will be done via understanding spatiotemporal and diurnal variations of temperatures, distinguishing between urban and rural areas, and identifying heat events in California over the past 20 years using hourly data.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? 

Questions: 
1. Spatiotemporal Variation in Temperatures:
   - How do temperature patterns vary across different geographical regions and over time?
   - Identify areas most susceptible to rapid temperature changes and extreme heat events.
3. Impact of Extreme Heat Events:
   - Assess the immediate and long-term effects of extreme heat events on local ecosystems and urban environments.
   - Evaluate the resilience of various land-use types to increasing temperatures.
4. Interactions Between Land-Use, Vegetation, and Temperature:
   - Investigate how different land-use practices and vegetation cover contribute to the urban heat island effect.
   - Determine the role of green spaces in mitigating heat and supporting ecosystem and public health.
5. Influence on Population Health:
   - Analyze the correlation between temperature variations/extreme heat events and public health outcomes.
   - Identify vulnerable populations and areas with high health risks due to heat stress.
